# Graphql chat using React and Nodejs

## I am currently learning graph theory in this quarantine to understand how mathematics is applied effectively in programming

## But in the meantime to get some rest I decided to chat using graphql to see it in practice (Graph Query Language)

## Libraries for nodejs that I used

### Graphql-Yoga https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-yoga
### Dotenv https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv
### Sequelize-ORM https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html

### Postgresql with database

# Graphql chat using React and Nodejs

## I am currently learning graph theory in this quarantine to understand how mathematics is applied effectively in programming

## But in the meantime to get some rest I decided to chat using graphql to see it in practice (Graph Query Language)

## Libraries for nodejs that I used

### Graphql-Yoga https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-yoga
### Dotenv https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv
### Sequelize-ORM https://sequelize.org/v5/manual/getting-started.html

## Libraries for ReactJS that I used

## styled-components: https://styled-components.com/
## Apollo-Client: https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/

### Postgresql with database

## Features that I will try to implement

## Image upload
## Tweets with images
## Followers
## Subscriptions
